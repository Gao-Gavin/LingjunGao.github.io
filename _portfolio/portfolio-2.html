## What is Regression Analysis?

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable \( Y \) and one or more independent variables \( X \).

### **1. Simple Linear Regression**
In a simple linear regression model, the relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \) is given by:

\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
\]

where:
- \( Y \) is the dependent variable (response),
- \( X \) is the independent variable (predictor),
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept,
- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope (coefficient),
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

### **2. Example Dataset**
Assume we have a dataset:

| X (Hours Studied) | Y (Exam Score) |
|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | 50 |
| 2 | 55 |
| 3 | 65 |
| 4 | 70 |
| 5 | 75 |

### **3. Fitting the Model**
We estimate \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) using the **least squares method**:

\[
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
\]

\[
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{X}
\]

Using these equations, we can fit a line to the data.

### **5. Conclusion**
Regression is a powerful tool in statistics and machine learning for predicting numerical outcomes. More advanced models include **multiple regression**, **logistic regression**, and **nonlinear regression**.
